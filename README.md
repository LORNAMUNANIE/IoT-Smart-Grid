# IoT-Smart-Grid

Iot smart grid is a grid model that has been intergrated with sensors to provide communication in the grid inorder to allow for rerouting of power incase of power loss.

To run this project on Arduino IDE, follow the following steps

connect your components to your Arduino board.(Follow the connection of the model representation diagram).
 
Connect your Arduino board to your computer using a USB cable.

Open the Arduino IDE.

In the Arduino IDE, select the board and serial port from the "Tools" menu.

Copy and the paste the code on the .INO file to your Arduino board.

Click on the "Verify" button to check for any errors in your code.

Click on the "Upload" button to upload the code to the Arduino board.

After the code has been uploaded, you should see a message indicating that the upload was successful.
